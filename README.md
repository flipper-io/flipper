## About

Flipper is a new kind of embedded development platform that lets developers use familiar tools to create amazing applications that interact with embedded hardware. Flipper can be controlled from [these](./languages) programming langauges running on desktop, mobile, and web applications.

1. **Purchase a board from our web store
   [here](https://flipper.io/products/flipper-carbon-developer-unit).**
    - You can't get started without a board. Pick one up today!
2. **Visit [this](https://github.com/flipper-io/flipper/wiki/Getting-Started)
Wiki page to set up your environment.**
    - Our Wiki is easy to navigate. Start at the top and work your way through it.
3. **Try out the examples [here](./examples).**
    - The best way to learn is by example. Dive head first into our intuitive examples.
4. **Ask questions!**
    - We are building a community around the platform, and we want you to be a part of it. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/R5zdK4m) server and ask questions, [email us](mailto:opensource@flipper.io), or open issues here on GitHub.

## Quickstart

### Install the dependencies

To build Flipper, you first need to install the project dependencies. To build
firmware images for the device you will need to install two GNU cross
compilers: `avr-gcc` and `arm-none-eabi-gcc`. To build and use libflipper you
will need to install `libusb-1.0`. To build and install the console you will
need to install the `rust` compiler and tools. To write firmware images to the
device, you will need `dfu-programmer`. You may selectively install dependencies
depending on what you wish to contribute to.

#### [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
```
brew tap osx-cross/avr osx-cross/arm
brew install rust libusb avr-gcc dfu-programmer arm-gcc-bin
```

#### APT
```
apt-get install build-essential libusb-1.0-0-dev
apt-get install dfu-programmer avr-libc binutils-avr gcc-avr
apt-get install libnewlib-arm-none-eabi binutils-arm-none-eabi gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

#### Rust

In addition to the dependencies installed via apt or brew, you will need to install the
Rust toolchain in order to compile the console. Cross-platform instructions on installing
Rust can be found at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

### Clone and build the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/flipper-io/flipper.git
cd flipper
make
```

To selectively build components of the project, see the table below.

|      Target     |                      Description                      |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `make libflipper` | Builds the [`library`](./library) that talks to the hardware. |
| `make console` | Builds the [`console`](./console) tool that creates and manages projects. |
| `make atmegau2` | Builds the firmware for the [`microcontroller`](./carbon/atmegau2). |
| `make atsam4s`| Build the embedded operating system for the [`microprocessor`](./carbon/atsam4s). |
| `make utils` | Builds the [`utilities`](./utils) needed to flash and debug the hardware. |

> All of the intermediates are placed in the `build` directory.

### Install the tools

Once you've built, you can install the platform library and tools.

```
make install
```
> The default `PREFIX` for installation is `/usr/local/`. If you wish to change the prefix, set the prefix before the install like `PREFIX=/path/to/prefix make install`

If you are on Linux, you will need to install the `udev` rule that lets
`libflipper` talk to the hardware. You will then need to trigger a rule reload:

```
cp assets/99-flipper.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
udevadm trigger
```

## Updating the Firmware

Once you get everything installed, you should update your board's firmware.
Attach only one Flipper device to your computer via USB, and then run the
following command.

```
make install-atmegau2
make install-atsam4s
```

## Example

Once you've installed the platform library and tools, you can try the example.
```
cd examples/app
make
```

This will build an application for the device. You can then install this
application onto the attached device.
```
make install
```

See the README for each example for details.

# How it works

Let's go through a brief tour of Flipper's major components and explain how
they all work together. Hopefully this will help to paint a clearer picture
of what Flipper is capable of.

```

Libflipper is the name of the library which captures function calls on the
host machine and sends them to Flipper. A host machine can be a desktop
computer, smartphone, or even a server. Hosts can communicate with Flipper
using any form of communication, with usb, wifi, and bluetooth being the main
three. In order to use high level programming languages, we have
"language bindings" which make use of libflipper in order to control Flipper.

Osmium is our affectionate name for Flipper's operating system. It's in charge
of communicating with libflipper and receiving instructions, then executing
code in the correct package and returning the result. Flipper comes with
several "standard" packages, which provide the core functionality of the board.
These correspond pretty closely to the peripherals in the hardware, giving
access to GPIO, USART, SPI, I2C, and more. However, Flipper allows you to
write your own packages. Packages always run directly on the device, meaning
that you get native performance, but every package can have language bindings
generated for it, allowing you to execute functions in that package remotely
from your language of choice.
