## About

Flipper is a new kind of embedded development platform that lets developers use familiar tools to create amazing applications that interact with embedded hardware. Flipper can be controlled from [these](./languages) programming langauges running on desktop, mobile, and web applications.

1. **Purchase a board from our web store
   [here](https://flipper.io/products/flipper-carbon-developer-unit).**
    - You can't get started without a board. Pick one up today!
2. **Visit [this](https://github.com/flipper-io/flipper/wiki/Getting-Started)
Wiki page to set up your environment.**
    - Our Wiki is easy to navigate. Start at the top and work your way through it.
3. **Try out the examples [here](./examples).**
    - The best way to learn is by example. Dive head first into our intuitive examples.
4. **Ask questions!**
    - We are building a community around the platform, and we want you to be a part of it. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/R5zdK4m) server and ask questions, [email us](mailto:opensource@flipper.io), or open issues here on GitHub.

## Quickstart

### Install the dependencies

To build Flipper, you first need to install the project dependencies. To build
firmware images for the device you will need to install two GNU cross
compilers: `avr-gcc` and `arm-none-eabi-gcc`. To build and use libflipper you
will need to install `libusb-1.0`. To build and install the console you will
need to install the `rust` compiler and tools. To write firmware images to the
device, you will need `dfu-programmer`. You may selectively install dependencies
depending on what you wish to contribute to.

#### [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
```
brew tap osx-cross/avr osx-cross/arm
brew install rust libusb avr-gcc dfu-programmer arm-gcc-bin
```

#### APT (Ubuntu 18.04)
```
apt-get install build-essential libusb-1.0-0-dev
apt-get install dfu-programmer avr-libc binutils-avr gcc-avr
apt-get install libnewlib-arm-none-eabi binutils-arm-none-eabi gcc-arm-none-eabi
apt-get install pkg-config python3-pip python3-pyelftools
```

#### dnf (Fedora 28)
```
dnf install libusb-devel-1
dnf install dfu-programmer avr-{gcc,gdb,binutils,libc}
dnf install arm-none-eabi-{gcc,gdb,binutils,newlib}
dnf install pkg-config "python?-pip" "python?-pyelftools"
```

#### Rust

In addition to the dependencies installed via apt or brew, you will need to install the
Rust toolchain in order to compile the console. Cross-platform instructions on installing
Rust can be found at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

### Clone and build the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/flipper-io/flipper.git
cd flipper
make
```

To selectively build components of the project, see the table below.

|      Target     |                      Description                      |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `make libflipper` | Builds the [`library`](./library) that talks to the hardware. |
| `make console` | Builds the [`console`](./console) tool that creates and manages projects. |
| `make atmegau2` | Builds the firmware for the [`microcontroller`](./carbon/atmegau2). |
| `make atsam4s`| Build the embedded operating system for the [`microprocessor`](./carbon/atsam4s). |
| `make utils` | Builds the [`utilities`](./utils) needed to flash and debug the hardware. |

> All of the intermediates are placed in the `build` directory.

### Install the tools

Once you've built, you can install the platform library and tools.

```
make install
```
> The default `PREFIX` for installation is `/usr/local/`. If you wish to change the prefix, set the prefix before the install like `PREFIX=/path/to/prefix make install`

If you are on Linux, you will need to install the `udev` rule that lets
`libflipper` talk to the hardware. You will then need to trigger a rule reload:

```
cp assets/99-flipper.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
udevadm trigger
```

### Add the Libraries to your Linker Path

Once the libraries are installed, you may need to add /usr/local/lib/
to your linker search path. This can be done by running the following
command as a user with sudo permissions.

```
echo /usr/local/lib | sudo tee -a /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf
sudo ldconfig
```

## Updating the Firmware

Once you get everything installed, you should update your board's firmware.
Attach only one Flipper device to your computer via USB, and then run the
following command.

```
make install-atmegau2
make install-atsam4s
```

## Example

Once you've installed the platform library and tools, you can try the example.
```
cd examples/app
make
```

This will build an application for the device. You can then install this
application onto the attached device.
```
make install
```

See the README for each example for details.
