The U2 has the ability to enumerate multiple endpoints using its USB hardware.
One of these endpoints can be configured as a debug endpoint and used to send
and receive debug messages to and from the hardware without blocking the FMR
endpoint. A module should be implemented that enables serial-like debugging using
this USB endpoint using a friendly print interface.
