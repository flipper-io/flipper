# Obj-C

The Objective-C component of the Flipper Toolbox wraps the functionality of the Flipper SDK to the Objective-C programming language for use with Apple's iOS, watchOS, TvOS, and Mac OS operating systems.

```
Flipper *elroy = [[Flipper alloc] initWithSource:FLIPPER_SOURCE_USB];

[[elory led] setColor:[UIColor colorWithRed:10 green:10 blue:10];
```

`[[elroy usart] push:[NSData dataWithString:"Hello World!"]];`

The Flipper SDK comes prepackaged with an Objective-C Framework called `Flipper.framework`.

This Framework can be imported internally from Xcode and used to control Flipper from any Apple device.
