 * This driver for Atmel&reg; | SMART ARM&reg;-based microcontrollers 
 * provides an interface for the configuration and management of the device's 
 * Reset Controller functionality.
 *
 * The Reset Controller manages all Resets of the System including;
 * external devices (via the NRST pin), Processor Reset and Peripheral Reset.
 * It also provides the status of the last reset source.
 *
 * The following peripheral is used by this module:
 *
 * - RSTC (Reset Controller)
 *
 * Devices from the following series can use this module:
 * - Atmel | SMART SAM3
 * - Atmel | SMART SAM4C
 * - Atmel | SMART SAM4CM

 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam_drivers_rstc_prerequisites Prerequisites
 * There are no prerequisites for this module.
 *
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam_drivers_rstc_module_overview Module Overview
 * The Reset Controller contains an NRST Manager and a Reset State Manager. It runs at
 * Slow Clock (SCLK) and generates the following:
 *
 * - Processor and Watchdog Timer reset
 * - Embedded peripheral reset
 * - Co-processor and Co-processor peripheral reset (SAM4C devices only)
 * - External device reset (via the NRST pin)
 *
 * These reset signals are asserted by the Reset Controller acting on external events
 * or as the result of an action performed by software. The Reset State Manager controls
 * the operation of reset signals and provides a signal to the NRST Manager when an
 * assertion of the NRST pin is required.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam_drivers_rstc_module_overview_nrst_manager NRST Manager
 * To control an external device reset the NRST Manager shapes the NRST assertion period
 * using a programmable timer. While asserted, after power-up, NRST is an output and
 * driven low. When the programmable time period has elapsed the pin behaves as an input
 * and all the system is held in reset if NRST is tied to GND by an external signal.
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_sam_drivers_rstc_module_overview_nrst_signal NRST Signal or Interrupt
 * The NRST Manager samples the NRST pin at Slow Clock (SCLK) speed and drives this pin
 * low when required by the Reset State Manager. When the line is detected as being low a
 * User Reset is reported to the Reset State Manager. However, the NRST Manager can be
 * programmed not to trigger a reset when NRST is asserted.
 *
 * The Reset controller can also be programmed to generate an interrupt instead of generating
 * a reset.
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_sam_drivers_rstc_module_overview_nrst_external NRST External Reset Control
 * The NRST Manager can assert NRST for a programmable time period of between 60Âµs and 2s
 * (approximately). This allows the Reset Controller to shape the NRST pin level and thus to
 * guarantee that the NRST line is low for a time that is compliant with any external devices
 * also connected to the system reset.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam_drivers_rstc_module_overview_reset_state Reset State Manager
 * The Reset State Manager handles the different reset sources and generates the internal reset
 * signals.
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_sam_drivers_rstc_module_overview_reset_state_general General Reset
 * A general reset occurs when either a Power-on-reset is detected or the Supply Controller
 * detects a Brownout or Voltage regulation loss.
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_sam_drivers_rstc_module_overview_reset_state_backup Backup Reset
 * A Backup Reset occurs when the chip returns from Backup Mode. The core_backup_reset signal
 * is asserted by the Supply Controller when a Backup Reset occurs.
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_sam_drivers_rstc_module_overview_reset_state_user User Reset
 * If User Reset is enabled then the state is entered when a low level is detected on the
 * NRST pin. When User Reset is entered both the Processor Reset and the Peripheral Reset
 * are asserted.
 *
 * The User Reset state is left when NRST rises and the processor clock is re-enabled as
 * soon as NRST is confirmed high.
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_sam_drivers_rstc_module_overview_reset_state_software Software Reset
 * The Reset Controller allows software to assert the the following reset signals:
 * - Reset the processor and the Watchdog Timer
 * - Reset all the embedded peripherals
 * - Reset the Co-processor (SAM4C devices only)
 * - Reset all the embedded peripherals associated with the Co-processor (SAM4C devices only)
 * - Assert NRST for a programmable time period
 *
 * \note The embedded peripheral reset also includes the memory system and the Remap Command
 * and is generally used for debugging purposes.
 *
 * \note For SAM4C devices the Co-processor peripheral reset only affects the embedded peripherals
 * associated with the Co-processor. The processor's peripherals are not reset.
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_sam_drivers_rstc_module_overview_reset_state_watchdog Watchdog Reset
 * The Watchdog Reset is entered when a watchdog fault occurs.
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_sam_drivers_rstc_module_overview_reset_state_priorities Reset State Priorities
 * The Reset State Manager manages the following priorities between the different reset sources,
 * given in descending order:
 * - General Reset
 * - Backup Reset
 * - Watchdog Reset
 * - Software Reset
 * - User Reset
 *
 * Particular cases are listed below:
 * - When in User Reset:
 *  - A watchdog event is impossible because the Watchdog Timer is being reset
 *  - A Software Reset is impossible because the processor reset is being activated
 * - When in Software Reset:
 *  - A watchdog event has priority over the current state
 *  - The NRST has no effect
 * - When in Watchdog Reset:
 *  - The processor reset is active and so a Software Reset cannot be programmed
 *  - A User Reset cannot be entered
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam_drivers_rstc_special_considerations Special Considerations
 * System designs using any external devices that require a software controllable
 * reset signal assertion longer than two seconds should use a dedicated I/O output
 * of the microcontroller.
